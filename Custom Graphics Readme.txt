Using custom graphics (assets):

If your custom assets folder is missing files, that's fine. 
Panel Attack will just use the stock assets for the missing files.

Step by step instructions for using custom graphics (Windows example):

1. Go to any Windows explorer window (my computer, my documents, my pictures, etc).

2. Type "%appdata%" without quotes into the address bar and hit enter.

3. See the folder: %appdata%\Panel Attack\assets\example folder structure
   for a reference of where your assets should go and what files should be named.

4. Make a folder in your game saves directory like this:
   %appdata%\Panel Attack\assets\[your_set_name_here]

5. Place assets in that folder with the proper file names
   and file paths of the assets you want to replace.

6. Restart Panel Attack.  Go into the options menu.  Select the graphics set with the 
   name you provided in step 4 (having multiple custom graphics sets is supported).

Note: if you would like to display a different character name for a custom character,
include a name.txt file in that character's folder. (but don't change the folder name!)
